	<p class="class2" align="center"><em>The king is the most important piece in the game of chess. If a players king is threatened with capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of capture on the next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting in a loss for that player. Players cannot make any move that places their own king in check. Although the king is the most important piece, it is usually the weakest piece in the game until the games ending phase.</em></p>
