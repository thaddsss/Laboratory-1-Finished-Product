<hr>
<p>Each player has eight pawns. They are usually moved first, and can move forward one square at a time except on their first move, when they can move two squares forward if desired. The pawn is the only piece that cannot move backward. The pawn can only capture on the diagonal. See Fig. 2.</p>

<h2>Knights</h2>

<p>Each player has two knights. The knight is the only piece that can jump over other men. He can move in any direction as long as he goes two squares up or down and one square to the left or right. He can also move one square up or down and two squares to the right or left. See Fig. 3.</p>

<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>Each player has two bishops that can only move diagonally along the squares of their color. They can move one or more squares at a time, but cannot jump over other men. See Fig. 4.</p>

<h2>Rooks</h2>

Each player has two rooks that can move vertically or horizontally one or more squares at a time. See Fig. 5.

<h2>Queen</h2>

<p>Each player has one queen that can move in any direction one or more squares at a time. The queen is very versatile. See Fig. 6.</p>

<h2>King</h2>
<hr>
<p>There is only one king per player. He can move in any direction but only one square at a time. NOTE: The king is the only player that cannot move to a square where he could be captured by his opponent. See Fig. 7.</p>

<p>Take some time and study the figures. Memorize where the pieces can move. Now you are ready to learn how to capture. In chess, an opponentâ€™s man can only be captured by one of your men landing directly on the square the opponentâ€™s man is occupying. A captured piece is always removed from the board. Pieces cannot be captured by jumping. You do not have to capture a piece unless you desire to do so.</p>

<p>Once you are able to understand the concept of capturing, you are ready to play with a partner.</p>

<h2>REMEMBER:</h2> <p>The object of the game is to protect your own king and put your partnerâ€™s king into checkmate, a position where the king will be captured on the next move and escape is impossible.</p>

<h2>Make Your Own Chess Set</h2>
<p>Carefully copy this chessboard or remove this page from the magazine. Glue it onto a piece of lightweight cardboard. Cut out the board, being sure to leave the numbers and letters attached. These will help you later when you learn chess notation (other plays or moves). Now cut out the individual pieces. Store the game in a large envelope. When you purchase a larger set, save this one for traveling or camping.</p><hr>
